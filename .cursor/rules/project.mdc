# Capitalos

## Architecture
Single Vite + React + TypeScript application:
- src/pages/ — page components
- src/components/ — shared UI components
- src/services/ — backend services (Firestore, exchange integrations, calculations)
- src/contexts/ — React contexts (Auth, Data, Currency, Theme, Incognito, ApiKeys)
- src/hooks/ — custom hooks (valuation, market-data)
- api/ — serverless API functions (perpetuals, snapshots, market data)
- docs/specs/ — engineering specs

## Source of Truth
- `docs/specs/requirements.md` — scope and intent
- `docs/specs/` — engineering specs
- `docs/ui/ui-improvement-guide.md` — UI/UX best practices

## UI
- Dark theme (primary background #050A1A), bronze/gold accents, Inter font.
- When improving UI, follow `docs/ui/ui-improvement-guide.md`.
