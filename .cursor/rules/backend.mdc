# Backend Standards

## Requirements
- Business logic belongs in service files, not inline in components.
- Validate inputs — never trust client data.
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase before introducing new ones.
- Consider database read/write costs — avoid unnecessary reads, use batched writes where appropriate.

## Constraints
- Do not create UI components — that belongs in pages/components.
- Do not skip input validation or auth checks.
- Keep changes focused — one concern per change.
