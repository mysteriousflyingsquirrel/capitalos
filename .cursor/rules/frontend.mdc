# Frontend Standards

## Requirements
- Always handle loading and error states — never leave the user with a blank screen.
- Consume services from the services/contexts layer — do not inline business logic.
- Follow the project's UI guidelines and design system.

## Constraints
- Do not modify backend services or data contracts.
- Do not introduce architectural decisions — reference existing patterns.
