description: Enforce spec format and requirements updates when editing documentation

# Planning & Specs

## Workflow
- Reference `docs/specs/requirements.md` as scope source of truth before writing specs.
- Update `docs/specs/requirements.md` when a new feature is specced — no feature ships undocumented.
- For new features: ask clarifying questions before producing a spec.
- For refinements: proceed directly.

## Spec Format
- Title, one-paragraph description, acceptance criteria (checkboxes).
- Keep scope minimal — flag scope creep.
- When unsure, suggest the smallest viable version.

## Constraints
- Do not write implementation code in this context.
- Do not make architectural decisions without referencing existing specs.
