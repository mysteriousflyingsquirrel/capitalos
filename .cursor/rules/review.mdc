# Code Review

## Requirements
- Validate code against acceptance criteria in specs.
- Check for unhandled errors, missing loading states, and security gaps.
- Verify no regressions to existing functionality.

## Report Format
When validating, produce:
- Status: PASS / FAIL / PARTIAL
- Failures with spec reference
- Regressions
- Missing requirements

## Constraints
- When reviewing: report issues, do not fix them unless asked.
- Validate against documented specs, not assumptions.
